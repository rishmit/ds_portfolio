## 📂 Projects

- [Comparison of Consumer Price Indexes of United States Key Metropolitan Areas During President Obama Presidency](./CPI_UnitedStates/CPI_UnitedStates.ipynb) - The project aims to looks at CPI data published by the BLS over a period ranging 1984 to 2023, and visualize how CPI has changed over time. Finally, it analyzes Barack Obama’s term as President and looks at how CPI for major Metropolitan areas evolved from the start of his presidency until the end of this second term presidency using Principal Component Analysis and Single Value Decomposition.

- [Analyzing Movie Sentiments](./Sentiment_Analysis/Analyzing_Movie_Sentiments.ipynb) - This project aims to build a comprehensive sentiment analysis on over 16k movie descriptions and correlate the findings with Metacritic ratings. The aim is to understand the effect of movie description on the audience reaction.

- [House Prediction](./HousePrediction/India_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb) - In this project we are looking at the Indian Housing Prices Dataset. The dataset contains 25k rows and 23 columns, offering detailed insights into housing market trends across various Indian states. It includes attributes related to property types, pricing, location, and amenities. We will be looking at basic statiscal analysis fro example average property prices across states, most expensive cities, etc, and apply some machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forrest to predict house prices.

- [Implement Tausworthe, L'Ecuyer and Mersenne Twister Pseudo Randon Number Generator](./Pseudo_Random_Number_Generator/Implementation_of_Psuedo_Random_Number_Generators.ipynb) - This project focuses on the implementation of three widely studied PRNGs — Tausworthe, L’Ecuyer’s combined multiple recursive generator (MRG32k3a), and the Mersenne Twister—within a Python programming environment. To evaluate the suitability of these generators, a number of statistical tests were conducted to assess whether their outputs exhibit characteristics of being independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a uniform distribution over the interval (0,1).
